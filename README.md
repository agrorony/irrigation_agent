# Irrigation Agent

A reinforcement learning project for irrigation scheduling optimization using Gymnasium environment.

## Overview

This project implements a configurable irrigation scheduling environment with:
- Configurable climatic regimes (ET₀ and rainfall ranges)
- Single-layer soil moisture dynamics
- Discrete crop growth stages
- Full Gymnasium API compliance

## Features

- **Climate Configuration**: Adjustable ET₀ and rainfall parameters for different climatic scenarios
- **State Space**: Soil moisture, crop stage, rainfall, and evapotranspiration
- **Action Space**: No irrigation, light irrigation, and heavy irrigation
- **Multiple Climate Scenarios**: Arid, humid, and Mediterranean climate simulations

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy gymnasium
```

## Usage

See the Jupyter notebooks for examples and demonstrations.
